# 🍳 Odin Recipes

This is a simple website where I practice using HTML by listing some recipes.

---

## 📚 What This Project Includes

- A homepage (`index.html`) with links to different recipes.
- A few recipe pages (like Spaghetti, Pancakes, and Guacamole).
- Just HTML — no colors, styles, or fancy effects. We're learning structure first!

---

## 📁 Files in This Project

- `index.html` - The main page where you can click on recipe names.
- `chakchouka.html` - One recipe page.
- `mshewsha.html` - Another recipe page.
- `shorba.html` - A third recipe page.

---

## 🔗 How the Pages Work

Each recipe page is its own file. The homepage has links so you can jump from one page to another.

---

## 👶 Goal

This project helps me practice:
- Writing clean HTML.
- Making links between pages.
- Organizing content with headings, paragraphs, and lists.

---

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click the links to see each recipe.
3. Try adding a new recipe by making another `.html` file and linking it from the homepage.

This might look plain, but that's okay! Right now, we're focusing on writing good HTML. Later, we can make it look nice with CSS.
