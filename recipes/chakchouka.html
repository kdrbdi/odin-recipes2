    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chakchouka is a traditional Algerian dish made with a flavorful mix of
      tomatoes, onions, and green peppers, cooked down into a rich sauce and
      often topped with eggs poached directly in the mixture. Seasoned with
      spices like paprika, cumin, and garlic, it's typically served hot with
      crusty bread. Simple yet hearty, Chakchouka is a popular comfort food
      across North Africa.
