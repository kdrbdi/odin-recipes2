    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      M'Shewsha is a traditional Algerian dish often enjoyed for breakfast or
      served with coffee. It features a base of beaten eggs mixed with semolina
      and a touch of flour, fried until fluffy and slightly golden. Warm honey
      is then poured over it, allowing it to soak in and create a rich,
      sweet-savory treat [[4]].
